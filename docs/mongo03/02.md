Methods to delete data in a MongoDB include deleting documents in the collections, dropping the entire collection, and dropping the entire database. Using the instruction, db.`<collection name>`.remove ({`<remove condition>`}), the relevant documents are deleted from the MongoDB. It is a method generally used to delete data. To drop the entire collection, the instruction db.`<collection name>`.drop() is used in the MongoDB shell, and to drop the entire database, the db.dropDatabase() instruction is used. In
Deleted data recovery
, we will examine the changes to the data file in each storage engine when data is deleted.

If a document is deleted from the WiredTiger storage engine, the page containing the document is excluded from the B-tree and a new page with the deletion applied is created and linked to the B-tree. The page excluded from the B-tree, in other words, the page containing the deleted document, does not get immediately deleted from the disk, but if additional data input and deletion occurs, it will be overwritten by a new page.
