### 3.1. PAGE OPERATIONS
{: .fs-10 .text-center }

When an existing btree is opened for the first time, the location of the root block is contained in the metadata file `WiredTiger.wt`. The block manager will read the block at the location specified and return the page image as a buffer to the layer above. This will then be instantiated as a page in memory.

From there subsequent page addresses can be read from the root page and the process repeated as required. If a cursor traverses to a page which hasn't been read into memory the same process will take place.
