### 3.3. SPACE MANAGEMENT
{: .fs-10 .text-center }

WiredTiger manages space using an extent data structure, where each extent includes a logical disk offset and size. There are three extent lists for each file that keep track of:

1. **Allocated Space**
2. **Available Space**
3. **Discarded Space**

Before a data buffer is actually written out, the latest update version is applied to the original on-disk image. Then, the space management system allocates the logical disk address for the upcoming write based on one of three approaches:

1. **First-Fit**: Selects the first extent in the available extent list that fits the data buffer.
2. **Best-Fit**: Selects the smallest extent that fits the data buffer.
3. **Append**: Adds the data buffer at the end of the file.
