### 3.3. COMPRESSION
{: .fs-10 .text-center }

{: .note }
**I/O is the main bottleneck** if the DBMS fetches data from disk during query execution.<br>
To mitigate this, the DBMS can **compress pages** to maximize the efficiency of the data moved per I/O operation.<br>

{: .important-title }

> Goals
>
> 1. **Fixed-Length Values**:
>    - The compression process should produce fixed-length values.
>    - The only exception is variable-length data, which should be stored in a separate pool.
> 2. **Postpone Decompression**:
>    - Decompression should be delayed as long as possible during query execution, a technique known as late materialization.
> 3. **Lossless Compression**:
>    - The compression scheme must ensure that no data is lost during the process.

## 3.3.1 Compression Granularity

1. <span style="color:red;">Block-level
- Compress a block of tuples for the same table.

2. **Tuple-level**
- Compress the contents of the entire tuple.

3. **Attribute-level**
- Compress a single attribute within one tuple.
- Can target multiple attributes for the same tuple.

4. **Column-level**
- Compress multiple values for one or more attributes stored for multiple tuples.

## 3.3.2. Compression Algorithms

WiredTiger, used by MongoDB, supports compression of data on disk across three specific areas. There are two primary compression algorithms available, each with its own trade-offs:

- **[`snappy` (2011)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_(software))**

  - The **default** compression algorithm used by WiredTiger.
  - It is used to compress the page.
  - It provides fast compression with low CPU overhead, making it suitable for general-purpose use where performance is a priority over maximum compression.
- **[`zlib` (1995)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlib)**

  - A widely-used compression algorithm that offers higher compression ratios than `snappy`.
  - It requires more CPU resources and time, making it better suited for scenarios where storage efficiency is more important than performance.
- **[`zstd` (2015)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zstd)**

  - A modern compression algorithm that balances high compression ratios with relatively fast processing times.
  - It generally provides better compression than `snappy` and is more efficient in terms of speed compared to `zlib`, but still requires more CPU than `snappy`.
- **`none`**

  - This option disables compression entirely, which may be desirable in cases where compression overhead is not acceptable or storage space is not a concern.

## 3.3.3. Compression Areas

WiredTiger allows compression in the following areas:

- **Collection Data**: Compresses the data within collections.
- **Index Data**: Compresses the data within indexes.
- **Journal Data**: Compresses the data used for ensuring redundancy and recoverability while being written to long-term storage.

## 3.3.4. Prefix Compression

MongoDB WiredTigerâ€™s row-store storage format supports a variant of prefix compression in the disk layout by identifying prefixes between adjacent keys, similar to delta-encoding:

- **Prefix Handling**:

  - Each key stores only the suffix key bytes and the number of prefix bytes common with the previous key.
  - The first key in the node is stored fully; following keys store only the suffix.

- **Key Decompression**:

  - Decompression requires finding a fully instantiated key and then walking forward to build the key.

## 3.3.5. Suffix Truncation

WiredTiger implements a suffix truncation technique:

- **Example**:
  - When a node splits between keys `"abfe"` and `"bacd"`, `"b"` is promoted to the parent node instead of the entire key `"bacd"`.

## 3.3.6 Key Instantiation Techniques

WiredTiger supports two key instantiation techniques to help with search and insertion:

1. **Best Prefix Group**:

   - Maintains a best slot whose base key can be used to decompress the most keys without scanning.
   - The most-used page key prefix is the longest group of compressed key prefixes that can be built from a single, fully instantiated key.
2. **Roll-forward Distance Control**:

   - Instantiates some keys in advance to avoid slow searches.
   - Limits how far the cursor must roll backward by setting a "skipping distance."
   - For each set of keys within this distance, WiredTiger instantiates the first key.
