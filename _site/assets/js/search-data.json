    "content": "2.1. DATA STORAGE . Document-Oriented Storage (BSON) . MongoDB’s document-oriented design, which we’ve discussed earlier, works seamlessly with BSON, the binary format used for storing documents. BSON, short for Binary JSON, is an open standard, and you can find its specification at bsonspec.org. Key Points about BSON . | Efficiency Over Space-Saving: &lt;br&gt; MongoDB prioritizes speed over space efficiency. While BSON might take up more space than JSON in some cases, it makes traversing and indexing documents much faster. This tradeoff is generally acceptable because MongoDB is designed to scale across machines, and storage is relatively inexpensive. WiredTiger, MongoDB’s default storage engine, supports multiple compression libraries and has index and data compression enabled by default. Compression levels can be configured both at the server level and per collection, allowing you to balance CPU usage with disk space savings. | Ease of Conversion: &lt;br&gt; BSON is easy to convert to a programming language’s native data format. If MongoDB used pure JSON, a higher-level conversion would be necessary, potentially slowing down operations. MongoDB drivers are available for many programming languages (e.g., Python, Ruby, PHP, C, C++, and C#), and each works slightly differently. The simple binary format of BSON allows native data structures to be built quickly in each language, making the code simpler and faster. | BSON Extension: &lt;br&gt; BSON provides some extensions to JSON, such as the ability to store binary data and specific data types. While BSON can store any JSON document, a valid BSON document may not be valid JSON. This distinction is handled by MongoDB’s drivers, which convert data to and from BSON without needing to use JSON as an intermediary format. | . The WiredTiger storage engine manages data in page units. The pages are connected via a B-tree structure and within each page, data is stored in a cell struct format. Additionally, to reduce data storage space, the Snappy compression algorithm is used to compress the page. The Snappy compression algorithm is used by default, but the settings can be changed. To search for a page in the WiredTiger storage engine metadata files, WiredTiger.tutle, WiredTiger.wt, and _md_catalog.wt must be interpreted. The WiredTiger.tutle file has a general text file format, and the WiredTiger.wt file’s root page offset is included in the configuration string. By interpreting the B-tree structure starting with the WiredTiger.wt file’s root page offset and then extracting the data, the configuration strings of the collection-#-####∼.wt file and the _md_catalog.wt file can be determined. The collection-#-####∼.wt file is the file where the actual data is stored. The _md_catalog.wt file stores data that can connect the namespace string and the data file name. The collection-#-####∼.wt file is the file that stores actual user data; one is created per collection. The # in the file name depicts the number, and the number behind the first hyphen increases by one as the files get created. The numbers behind the second hyphen are 19 randomly generated numbers that define the file name. User data is stored in a BSON format in the cell struct of the leaf page. ",

    "content": "2.2. INDEXES MongoDB offers extensive support for indexing documents, a crucial feature when dealing with large collections containing tens of thousands of documents. Without an index, MongoDB would need to scan each document individually to find the data you need—similar to a librarian searching every book in a library to find the one you’re looking for. In contrast, an indexing system allows MongoDB to quickly locate the relevant documents, much like how a librarian uses the Dewey Decimal system to locate books. Built-in Indexing on _id Key . | Automatic Indexing: All documents in MongoDB are automatically indexed on the _id key. This key is special because it cannot be deleted, and the index ensures that each value is unique. This guarantees that every document is uniquely identifiable, something that traditional RDBMS systems don’t always ensure. | . Creating Custom Indexes . | Uniqueness Enforcement:When creating your own indexes, you can decide whether to enforce uniqueness. By default, MongoDB will return an error if you try to create a unique index on a key that has duplicate values. However, there are many scenarios where allowing duplicates in an index is beneficial. For instance, if your application frequently searches by last name, it makes sense to create an index on the lastname key, even though duplicates are likely. | Indexing Embedded Documents:MongoDB also supports indexing embedded documents. For example, if you store addresses in an address field, you can create an index on the ZIP or postal code. This enables you to quickly retrieve documents based on postal codes. | Composite Indexes: MongoDB allows you to create composite indexes, which use two or more keys to build a single index. For example, you could create an index that combines both lastname and firstname fields. This would make searching for a full name very efficient, as MongoDB can rapidly narrow down the results. | . Data Modeling and Indexing in MongoDB . | Conceptual Mapping with RDBMS:In MongoDB, there is a conceptual mapping between traditional RDBMS data models and MongoDB’s approach. A MongoDB collection corresponds to a table in RDBMS, a BSON document is similar to a row, and key-value pairs in a document are analogous to fields in a row. | Primary Index on _id:When a new document is created, MongoDB automatically assigns an _id as the primary key, with its value increasing monotonically. A primary index is also automatically built based on the _id key. | Secondary Indexes:MongoDB supports secondary indexes, and each time a new secondary index is created, a corresponding index file is generated in the associated directory. However, when deciding to add a secondary index, you must carefully consider the trade-off between read and write performance. For workloads with frequent updates, more secondary indexes can slow down the system, as each update to collection pages requires corresponding updates to the secondary indexes. | Storage Structure: MongoDB’s WiredTiger storage engine uses the B+Tree data structure to store both collection and index files. Unlike RDBMS, MongoDB offers flexible schemas within its semi-structured BSON format, and JOIN operations are not necessary in MongoDB. | . ",

This flexibility in lock granularity is essential for optimizing performance and concurrency in a multi-user environment. | Database Level: . | At the highest level of granularity, a lock can be applied to an entire database. This type of lock would restrict access to all collections and documents within that database.

The DBMS can compress pages to increase the utility of the data moved per I/O operation. Goal #1: Must produce fixed-length values. → Only exception is var-length data stored in separate pool. Goal #2: Postpone decompression for as long as possible during query execution. → Also known as late materialization. Goal #3: Must be a lossless scheme. WiredTiger supports compression of your data on disk. There are three places within your data storage that WiredTiger can compress your data and there are two compression algorithms you can use with your data that have slightly different trade-offs: . | The first and default compression algorithm is the snappy compression algorithm. This compression algorithm provides good compression and has really low overhead in terms of CPU usage. | The second algorithm is the zlib compression algorithm. This algorithm provides very high compression but costs significantly more in terms of CPU and time. | The third and final compression available within MongoDB is the none compression algorithm, which simply disables compression. | . Now that we have covered the compression algorithms, we can look at which MongoDB data you can compress: . | Data in your collections. | Index data, which are the data in your indexes. | Journal data, which is that used to ensure your data are redundant and recoverable while they are being written into your long-term data storage. | . Finally, armed with a sense of understanding of what compression can be used on which data, let’s look at how you can compress things. It’s important to note that these options are set in your MongoDB configs when you boot up your instance and will affect only new data objects when created. Any existing objects will continue to use the compression they were created with. For example, if you create a collection with the default snappy compression algorithm and then decide you wish to use the zlib compression algorithm for your collections, your existing collections will not switch to snappy but any new collections will be made with zlib. The setting of compression algorithms is done with three different YAML configuration settings that take either snappy, zlib, or none as the values: . | For Journal compression you use the storage.wiredTiger.engineConfig. journalCompressor YAML configuration option, which takes a value of the name of the compression lib you wish to use. | For Index compression you use the storage.wiredTiger.indexConfig. prefixCompression YAML configuration option, which takes a true or false value to say if index prefix compression should be on or off. This is on by default. | For Collection compression you use the storage.wiredTiger.collectionConfig. blockCompressor YAML configuration option, which takes a value of the name of the compression lib you wish to use. | . With these options you should be able to configure the compression in your system to best suit your needs. The WiredTiger storage engine manages data in page units. The pages are connected via a B-tree structure and within each page, data is stored in a cell struct format. Additionally, to reduce data storage space, the Snappy compression algorithm is used to compress the page. The Snappy compression algorithm is used by default, but the settings can be changed.

    "title": "3.5. Logging",
    "content": "3.5. LOGGING . To ensure consistency and durability, MongoDB employs a journaling approach and periodically triggers checkpoints at defined intervals. Crashes between checkpoints, however, may result in a loss of writes that have not yet been written to disk. Write-ahead logging (WAL) provides a way to make these writes durable. Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) . Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) is a family of techniques designed to provide atomicity and durability (two of the ACID properties) in database systems. WAL involves wrapping information about the current write operation and storing it durably before confirming the write to the client application. A log sequence number (LSN) is usually associated with each logged write to establish the happen-before relation between logs. Log records are stored in a memory log buffer and are later synchronously written to non-volatile storage by the WAL protocol. Upon failure, a data recovery scheme like ARIES replays all logs in LSN order to reconstruct the state of the database immediately prior to the crash. | Name | Definition | . | alloc_lsn | Next log record allocation | . | ckpt_lsn | Last checkpoint | . | sync_lsn | Last record synced to disk | . | write_lsn | End of the last record written to the operating system | . | write_start_lsn | Start of the last record written to the operating system | . WiredTiger uses B-trees to store data in volatile memory. A snapshot is a consistent, durable view of these B-trees, which is periodically written out to disk. Starting from version 3.6, MongoDB configures WiredTiger to create checkpoints (i.e., write the snapshot data to disk) every 60 seconds. To provide durability in the event of failure between checkpoints, WiredTiger uses WAL to maintain on-disk journal files. WiredTiger creates one log record for each client-initiated write operation. A log record wraps all internal write operations to WiredTiger’s in-memory data structures caused by the application-initiated write. A log record consists of a 16-byte header and data. The first 4 bytes of the header contain the length of the record, and this length is always a multiple of 4 bytes. MongoDB configures WiredTiger to buffer all log records up to 128 KB in an in-memory data structure called the slot. Slots are synchronously flushed to non-volatile storage every 100 milliseconds or upon a full-sync write, whichever comes first. A full-sync write is a write operation that requires its journal record to be flushed to non-volatile storage before returning, ensuring that the written data survives a crash. This provides the strictest durability, in contrast to non-sync writes where the data is recorded in a buffer in memory but is not guaranteed to be immediately written to non-volatile storage. After a full-sync write is issued by the client to the query executor, all records in the slot buffer must be synchronized to non-volatile storage to commit the write. Checkpoints . In addition to journaling, MongoDB periodically initiates a checkpoint process at specific intervals (every 60 seconds) or when the volume of log data written reaches a threshold (2 GB). | Write Dirty Leaf Pages: . | Instead of overwriting existing data, new versions of dirty leaf pages are written into free space on disk. | . | Write Internal Pages, Including the Root: . | The internal pages, along with the root page, are written. Importantly, the old checkpoint remains valid until this process is complete. | . | Sync the File: . | The file containing the new pages is synced to ensure all changes are properly written to disk. | . | Update Metadata with New Root Address: . | The new root page’s address is written to the metadata. Once the metadata is durable, pages from old checkpoints can be freed. | . | . After every checkpoint, all journal records whose writes happened before the checkpoint are automatically garbage-collected, freeing space for future journal records. In this sense, the journal can be thought of as a circular buffer for write operations. WiredTiger keeps track of the current checkpoint and the current starting point for WAL in the journal file. Recovery . When recovering from a crash, WiredTiger first looks in the data files for the identifier of the last checkpoint, then searches the journal files for the record that matches this identifier. WiredTiger then reads log records one by one from the journal file: . | First, it scans through the 16-byte fixed-size header to obtain meta-information, such as the size of the entire record. | Second, it reads through the data part of the log record according to the meta-information. | After reading each record, it immediately applies it and continues to the next record until all records are consumed. | . This structured approach ensures that MongoDB can recover reliably and efficiently from crashes, maintaining the integrity and durability of the data. ",

    "content": "CPU speeds have remained relatively constant for the past decade, but servers now have the capability to support more CPUs. Modern servers are equipped with many CPUs or cores, and each core has multiple memory caches that need to maintain cache coherence by “snooping” on writes to ensure consistency. Traditional data engines face challenges with this architecture because writing to shared memory is slow, and snoopy cache coherence does not scale well. Databases, which manage shared access to data, are particularly affected by these limitations. MongoDB addressed these challenges by transitioning from the MMAPv1 storage engine to WiredTiger. This decision was driven by the need for lower storage costs, better hardware utilization, and more predictable performance—critical requirements for handling the demands of modern, multi-core servers.

    "content": "WiredTiger offers several advantages that make it well-suited for these environments: . | Feature | WiredTiger | MMAPv1 | . | Scalability | Designed to perform better on multicore systems, making it more scalable in modern server environments. | Not optimized for scaling with multiple cores; adding CPU cores does not significantly improve performance. | . | Concurrency | Uses MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control) for document-level concurrency, allowing simultaneous transactions. | Uses collection-level locking, limiting concurrency and potentially leading to performance bottlenecks under high workloads. | . | Data Storage | Utilizes a B-tree layout for data storage, offering efficient data organization and retrieval. | Uses memory-mapped files, which are less efficient in terms of data organization and retrieval. | . | Compression | Supports gzip and snappy (default) compression for indexes and collections, leading to smaller collection sizes. | Does not support compression, resulting in larger collection sizes. | . |   | Also supports index-prefix compression, reducing index size both on disk and in memory. |   | . By adopting WiredTiger, MongoDB provides a more robust solution for the challenges of modern server architectures. WiredTiger’s design supports the scalability and performance demands of high-scale applications, making it the preferred choice over the previous MMAPv1 engine. The use of locking mechanisms further helps manage data access and consistency in multi-core environments, ensuring MongoDB can efficiently handle concurrent operations. ",

    "content": "3. BLOCK MANAGER . WiredTiger’s storage architecture is optimized for multi-core CPUs and large memory. It consists of two key components: in-memory cache and disk block manager. Here’s a brief overview: . | In-Memory Cache: Implemented using a B-tree structure with hazard pointers. B-tree nodes are organized at the page level, and the cache eviction policy follows the LRU (Least Recently Used) algorithm. | Disk Block Manager: Handles raw block I/O operations, including: . | Reading and Writing Pages | Checksum/Verification | Space Management | Compression | Checkpoints | . | . In-Memory Page Format . WiredTiger represents database tables using a B-Tree data structure (WT_BTREE in btree.h). The B-tree is composed of nodes, which are page structures: . | Root and Internal Pages: Store keys and references to other pages. | Leaf Pages: Store keys and values. As users insert data, records are kept in sorted order. When a page reaches its limit, it splits, causing the B-tree to expand. | . On-Disk Page Format . Extents represent ranges of contiguous blocks on disk. Extents are categorized as: . | alloc: Blocks allocated for storing data. | avail: Blocks that have been allocated but are not currently in use. | discard: Blocks that have been freed up during the checkpoint process. | . This structure lays the foundation for how WiredTiger manages data both in memory and on disk. In the subsequent sections, we will delve deeper into how the block manager operates within this structure, including how it handles I/O operations, manages space, and ensures data integrity through checkpoints and other mechanisms.
